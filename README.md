# Transfer-Learning

This repository explores transfer learning techniques for machine learning and deep learning applications.

## Contents

- `crop_disease_detector.tsx`: Implements a crop disease detector using transfer learning. This file likely contains code for building, training, or deploying a model for agricultural disease detection.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aoluwar/Transfer-Learning.git
```

Install dependencies and follow instructions provided in each file or script.

## About Transfer Learning

Transfer learning leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem and applies it to a different but related problem. This approach is especially useful when labeled data is scarce for the target task.

## Usage

Refer to the code in `crop_disease_detector.tsx` for practical examples of transfer learning implementation.
